**Supply Chain Analytics Project **

The supply chain dataset consists of 6 sheets, each containing over 100 rows of data. These sheets encompass various aspects of the supply chain, including product details, pricing, sales performance, shipping metrics, and cash flow status. The dataset is primarily intended for revenue analysis, with a focus on reducing delays, improving completion rates, and ultimately optimizing the supply chain across different company locations. By leveraging these insights, the goal is to develop tailored sales strategies for each location while enhancing overall supply chain efficiency. 

**Problem Statement**
1. Current Situation:
The company is facing challenges with delayed processes and payment inefficiencies, impacting sales performance across regions.

2. Problems:
A meeting involving the Sales Region Manager, Supply Chain, and Finance departments failed to identify the root causes due to a lack of supporting data. Discussions were based on assumptions rather than concrete evidence.

3. Assignment:
The Supply Chain Manager assigned you to collect and analyze data from Sales, Supply Chain, and Finance to uncover the root causes and develop targeted strategies.

4. Goal:
Analyze the dataset, which includes product sales, orders, profitability, shipping, and payment process data, to derive actionable insights and recommendations for optimizing supply chain operations and enhancing regional profitability.
